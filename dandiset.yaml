description: We present an electrophysiological dataset recorded from nine subjects
  during a verbal working memory task. Subjects were epilepsy patients undergoing
  intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic seizures. Subjects performed
  a modified Sternberg task in which the encoding of memory items, maintenance, and
  recall were temporally separated. The dataset includes simultaneously recorded scalp
  EEG with the 10-20 system, intracranial EEG (iEEG) recorded with depth electrodes,
  waveforms and spike times of 1526 units recorded in the medial temporal lobe, and
  the MNI coordinates and anatomical labels of all intracranial electrodes. Subject
  characteristics and information on sessions (set size, match/mismatch, correct/incorrect,
  response, response time for each trial) are also provided. This dataset enables
  the investigation of working memory by providing simultaneous scalp EEG and iEEG
  recordings, which can be used for connectivity analysis, alongside hard to obtain
  unit recordings from humans.
